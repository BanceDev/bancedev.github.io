            Your Linux Distro Doesn't Matter
          </h1>

          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            In the rare event that two Linux users encounter each other in the wild there is a high likelihood that the first question asked will be "What distro do you use?" followed by a conceited "I use Arch btw".
          </p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            Distros are an inseparable part of the modern Linux experience. It's a source of identity and pride for many or just a means to an end if you use some Debain or Fedora spin because modifying dotfiles incessantly does not in fact increase productivity contrary to the propaganda one may find.
          </p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            As someone who started out on Arch Linux I am no stranger to distro propaganda but the more familiar I have become with Linux and the skills I’ve gained as a developer I’m not convinced that there is much of a meaningful difference between Linux distributions.
          </p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            It seems to me that there are three main reasons why people choose one distro over another. The first, and in my opinion the most valid reason, is the package manager. While any skilled Linux user could go out of their way to change the package manager on their system it seems pointless to do so when you could use a stripped down distro that supplies the package manager you want. 
          </p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            The second reason, and probably the most common one, is desktop environment/perceived customization. The big selling point for the obscene number of Ubuntu spins seems to just be the desktop environment and for many newer users this seems helpful. Frankly a desktop environment/ window manager is just a package like any other piece of software and is not actually a part of the operating system. 
          </p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            The third reason is just the clout. I put this one in here for all the reddit Arch users who have no clue what they’re doing and just beg for dotfiles on r/unixporn so they can seem intellectually superior to the zero people they know in real life. No shade, I used to be one of you. Unfortunately nobody actually cares that you run Arch and more than likely you should all be diagnosed with narcissism of small differences.
          </p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            At the end of the day though, what really is a Linux distro? To me it is a means to an end. A choice of how I want to download my packages and how often I want updates shipped to me. This is why I presently am daily driving Hyprland on Ubuntu. There is nothing stopping me from having the software I desire. If a package manager doesn’t carry it then I can compile from source. Of course then I have to maintain updating those packages on my own time but that isn’t something very challenging. 
          <p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            I’m not saying that the way I run Linux is suitable for everyone, and I’m not saying that we shouldn’t have Linux distros but rather that the difference between distros is much smaller than the average person seems to think. Arch Linux does not give you more customization than Ubuntu, you are just forced to make something out of nothing but a tty. In my opinion it is best to just choose what level of stability serves your purposes and then to build up from there. I don’t feel any more or less of a Linux user when I’m on Arch, Debian, Fedora, or Ubuntu. It’s a matter of getting real about what you need from a system and then building a user interface from there. 
          </p>
          <p class = "pt-4 pb-4">
            An operating system should work for you, if it gets in your way it is not properly serving you as an end user. Linux is a system that gives you nearly complete control over your operating system experience so build a system that works for you and your relationship with technology will be much more fruitful.
